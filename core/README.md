[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@agnos-ui/core)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agnos-ui/core)

[AgnosUI](https://amadeusitgroup.github.io/AgnosUI/latest/) is a framework-agnostic widget library with adapters for multiple frameworks:

- [Angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agnos-ui/angular)
- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agnos-ui/react)
- [Svelte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agnos-ui/svelte)

This `@agnos-ui/core` package contains the framework-agnostic common code used by the above framework adapters.

Please check [our demo site](https://amadeusitgroup.github.io/AgnosUI/latest/) to see all the available widgets and how to use them.

Unless you want to develop an adapter for a framework, you probably do not need to use `@agnos-ui/core` directly. Please refer to one of the framework-specific packages.
