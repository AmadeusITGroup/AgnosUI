At its heart, a transition is a [Directive](../01-Headless/03-Directives.md) managing the visibility of inner content by attaching / detaching classes.\n\n## In action\n\nCreating and attaching a transition is straighforward! Simply create a transition service using the factory `createTransition` and attach the provided directive to a dom element.  \nLet's see this in action by implementing a **Collapse** component:\n\n```sample\n{Collapse example:transition/collapse:129}\n```\n\nAgnosUI provides several transition functions to use (collapse vertical or horizontal, fade in/out) but you may create your own using the `createSimpleClassTransition` utility and a bit of css. Here is another example with a flip animation:\n\n```sample\n{Flip in example:transition/flip:93}\n```\n\n\u003Cp>\n    When creating your own, remember to respect the user preferences and the media query \u003Ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion\" target=\"_blank\">prefers-reduced-motion\u003C/a>.\n\u003C/p>\n\n## Properties and stores\n\nYou can configure a transition using the following properties:\n\n- **transition** `TransitionFn` : the transition function that will be run\n- **visible** `boolean` : whether the element should be visible when the transition is completed\n- **animation** `boolean` : whether the transition should be animated\n- **animationOnInit** `boolean` : if the element is initially visible, whether the element should be animated when first displayed\n- **onShown** `() => void` : function to be called when the transition is completed and the element is visible\n- **onHidden** `() => void` : function to be called when the transition is completed and the element is not visible\n- **onVisibleChange** `(visible: boolean) => void` : function to be called when the visible property changes\n\nThe state of the transition will include the stores:\n\n- **visible** `boolean` : whether the element is visible or will be visible when the transition is completed\n- **elementPresent** `boolean` : whether the element to be animated is present in the DOM\n- **element** `HTMLElement | null` : reference to the DOM element\n- **transitioning** `boolean` : whether a transition is currently running\n- **shown** `boolean` : whether the element is visible and not transitioning\n- **hidden** `boolean` : whether the element is not visible and not transitioning\n\nYou may play around the properties and see the stores updated with the following example:\n\n```sample\n{Transition properties and stores:transition/transition:585:noCode:noResize}\n```\n","Transition","",{"since":8},"0.2.0","# Match Media\n\n## Service Overview\n\n\u003Cp>\nThe match media service is a simple factory that wraps the \u003Ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia\" target=\"_blank\">Window: matchMedia()\u003C/a> method into a Tansu readable store.\n\u003C/p>\n\n```typescript\ntype createMatchMedia = (query: string) => Readable\u003Cboolean>;\n```\n\n## In action\n\n```sample\n{MatchMedia:matchMedia/matchMedia:138}\n```\n","0.3.0",{"description":12},"Documentation for services match media"],"uses":{"params":["slug","framework"]}}]}
