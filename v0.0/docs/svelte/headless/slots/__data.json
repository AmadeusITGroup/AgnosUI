Here is an example with the Bootstrap flavour of the **Pagination** component:\n\n```sample\n{Slot Context:slots/context:220}\n```\n\n## Integration with Configuration\n\nAs explained above, AgnosUI slots are inherently properties, thus benefit from the [Configuration](01-Configuration.md).  \nFor instance, we may configure the _slotStructure_ of the **Alert** to use a custom component, allowing to fully customize the widget.\n\n```sample\n{Slot Configuration:alert/icon:402}\n```\n\n## Slots in Svelte\n\nSvelte manages slots using the [slot special element](https://svelte.dev/docs/special-elements#slot).  \nNote that this will change when Svelte 5 comes out and brings snippets to the fray.  \nWe support this behavior, while going further.\n\nThe AgnosUI Svelte slots can be set using:\n\n- a simple `string`\n- a function `(props: Props) => string`\n- a Svelte component\n\n\n## Headless example\n\nYou can check out the following example, re-writing the Bootstrap flavour of the **Rating** component as readonly:\n\n```sample\n{Slot Headless:slots/headless:148}\n```\n",{"slug":3,"mdpath":4,"title":5,"name":5,"subpath":6},"headless/configuration","../docs/01-Headless/01-Configuration.md","Configuration","",{"slug":8,"mdpath":9,"title":10,"name":10,"subpath":6},"headless/directives","../docs/01-Headless/03-Directives.md","Directives","headless/slots"],"uses":{"params":["slug","framework"]}}]}
