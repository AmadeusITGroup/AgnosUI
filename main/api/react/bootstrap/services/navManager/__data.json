keyboard navigation for a set of DOM elements.\nIt provides a directive to use on some DOM elements, both to add the keydown event handler and to specify which elements should be managed\n(either by directly putting the directive on those elements, or by putting the directive on a parent element and\nspecifying which child elements should be included through a selector function).\n\nIt provides some utilities to move the focus between those elements (focusFirst/focusLast, focusLeft/focusRight, focusPrevious/focusNext).\n\n### Type Parameters\n\n• **T**\n\nThe type of the context object used
