These concepts are deeply explained in the [Introduction](00-Introduction.md) and [Headless](../01-Headless/00-Introduction.md).\n\n## Headless widgets\n\nEach widget is delivered in headless mode in Angular, React and Svelte using the same factory, but you can also use sthese factories for other JS framework of your choice, with a bit work work to create adapters.\nYou can use widgets with any front-end CSS framework.\nThis approach frees you from the complexity of widget logic, enabling you to concentrate on making your design stand out.\n\n## Accessible\n\nWidgets are designed with a strong emphasis on accessibility. We adhere to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag) and established design patterns, by providing keyboard navigation, aria attributes and focus handlers; features are available in headless components, and rigorously tested in the bootstrap version of each component.\n\n## Highly configurable\n\nWidgets offer a multitude of properties and access points that allow for customization of their behavior, appearance, and user experience. These attributes can be uniquely configured for each widget instance at any given time.\n\n## Consistency\n\nCore is fully tested to ensure consistent functionality across different framework implementations of the widgets. Additionally, we maintain uniformity in the markup used by each frameworkâ€™s widget implementation\n\n## Bootstrap CSS widgets\n\nBootstrap CSS widgets are available for Angular, React and Svelte in separated packages.\n",{"slug":3,"mdpath":4,"title":5,"name":5,"subpath":6,"status":6},"getting-started/introduction","../docs/00-Getting-started/00-Introduction.md","Introduction","",{"slug":8,"mdpath":9,"title":10,"name":10,"subpath":6,"status":6},"getting-started/installation","../docs/00-Getting-started/02-Installation.md","Installation","getting-started/features"],"uses":{"params":["slug","framework"]}}]}
