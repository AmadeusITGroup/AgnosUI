Here is an example with the Bootstrap flavour of the **Pagination** component:\n\n```sample\n{Slot Context:slots/context:220}\n```\n\n## Integration with Configuration\n\nAs explained above, AgnosUI slots are inherently properties, thus benefit from the [Configuration](01-Configuration.md).  \nFor instance, we may configure the _slotStructure_ of the **Alert** to use a custom component, allowing to fully customize the widget.\n\n```sample\n{Slot Configuration:alert/icon:402}\n```\n\n## Slots in Angular\n\nAngular applications usually handle slots using [content projection](https://angular.dev/guide/components/content-projection).  \nWe support this behavior, while going further.\n\nThe AgnosUI Angular slots can be set using:\n\n- a simple `string`\n- a function `(props: Props) => string`\n- a [TemplateRef](https://angular.io/api/core/TemplateRef)\n- an Angular component\n- a `ComponentTemplate`, an AgnosUI utility allowing to use an Angular component without the host element\n\n\n## Headless example\n\nYou can check out the following example, re-writing the Bootstrap flavour of the **Rating** component as readonly:\n\n```sample\n{Slot Headless:slots/headless:148}\n```\n",{"slug":3,"mdpath":4,"title":5,"name":5,"subpath":6,"status":6},"headless/configuration","../docs/01-Headless/01-Configuration.md","Configuration","",{"slug":8,"mdpath":9,"title":10,"name":10,"subpath":6,"status":6},"headless/directives","../docs/01-Headless/03-Directives.md","Directives","headless/slots"],"uses":{"params":["slug","framework"]}}]}
