Floating UI\n\n## Service Overview\n\nThe Floating UI service is designed to create a flexible and dynamic floating DOM element that can be positioned relative to a reference element. It provides a set of options for customization, including positioning configuration, auto-updating behavior, and arrow styling.\n\nThe service uses a 3rd party library called [floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/).\n\nBy leveraging the provided directives and state stores, developers can easily integrate floating UI elements into their web applications with flexibility and control.\n\n## `createFloatingUI` factory\n\nUse the `createFloatingUI` function to create an instance of the Floating UI service.\nPass an optional `propsConfig` parameter to customize the initial configuration.\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nThe `propsConfig` parameter allows you to provide initial values for the following options:\n\n- **computePositionOptions** Option for positioning the floating UI relative to the reference element. Refer to [computePosition documentation](https://floating-ui.com/docs/computeposition#options) for defaults and options.\n- **autoUpdateOptions** Option for enabling auto-updating of the floating position. Refer to [autoUpdate documentation](https://floating-ui.com/docs/autoupdate#options) for defaults and options.\n- **arrowOptions** Option to customize the arrow element associated, by giving the element itself and eventually a padding. Refer to [arrow documentation](https://floating-ui.com/docs/arrow#options) for defaults and options.\n\n## Output Directives\n\n1. **Reference Directive** Apply this directive to the reference element from which the floating UI will be positioned.\n\n2. **Floating Directive** Apply this directive to the floating UI element. This directive includes styling updates based on the floating UI position.\n3. **Arrow Directive** Apply this directive to the arrow element, if present. This directive includes styling updates based on the arrow position.\n\n## State Stores\n\nThe Floating UI service exposes several state stores that represent different aspects of the UI position:\n\n- `x$`: X-coordinate of the floating UI.\n- `y$`: Y-coordinate of the floating UI.\n- `strategy$`: Strategy used for positioning.\n- `placement$`: Placement of the floating UI.\n- `middlewareData$`: Additional data provided by middleware.\n\n## Patching States\n\nFloating UI instance includes a `patch` method that allows you to patch the configuration dynamically at runtime.\n\n## Usage\n\n### In Action\n\n```sample\n{FloatingUI:floatingUI/floatingUI:500}\n```\n","Floating UI","",{"since":8},"0.1.1",{"slug":10,"content":11,"title":12,"status":6,"attributes":13},"services/navigation-manager","# Navigation Manager\n\n## Service Overview\n\nThis service simplifies keyboard navigation for a set of DOM elements. It exposes a factory function `createNavManager()` that creates an object containing:\n\n- `elementsInDomOrder$` - a store containing the navigable elements in DOM order\n- `directive` - a directive to use on some DOM elements, both to add the keydown event handler and to specify which elements should be managed (either by directly putting the directive on those elements, or by putting the directive on a parent element and specifying which child elements should be included through a `selector` function via `NavManagerItemConfig`)\n- Utilities to navigate the items:\n  - `refreshElements` - method to manually refresh the `elementsInDomOrder$` to capture the latest state of DOM\n  - `focusIndex` - method to focus the element at the given index within `elementsInDomOrder$`\n  - `focusFirst` - method to focus the first element in the DOM order\n  - `focusLast` - method to focus the last element in the DOM order\n  - `focusPrevious` - method to focus the previous element in the DOM order\n  - `focusNext` - method to focus the next element in the DOM order\n  - `focusFirstLeft` - method to focus the element at the left-end of the list (identical to `focusFirst` in a LTR configuration and to `focusLast` in a RTL configuration)\n  - `focusFirstRight` - method to focus the element at the right-end of the list (identical to `focusLast` in a LTR configuration and to `focusfirst` in a RTL configuration)\n  - `focusLeft` - method to focus the next focusable element to the left of the currently focused element (identical to `focusPrevious` in a LTR configuration and to `focusNext` in a RTL configuration)\n  - `focusRight` - method to focus the next focusable element to the right of the currently focused element (identical to `focusNext` in a LTR configuration and to `focusPrevious` in a RTL configuration)\n\n## Usage\n\nWhenever you want to custom keyboard navigation within a defined set of DOM elements you can simply:\n\n- use the factory function to create the NavManager object\n- use the `NavManagerItemConfig` to configure the NavManger by setting:\n  - `keys` - a map of key handlers. The key in the map should match the key event (for example, `\"ArrowLeft\"` or `\"Ctrl+PageDown\"`). The value in the map is the corresponding key handler. (for example, the `focusNext` or `focusPrevious` function returned by `createNavManager`)\n  - `selector` - a function returning DOM elements to include in the navigation manager. It receives as a parameter the DOM element on which the navigation manager directive is used. If not specified, the default selector function only returns the element on which the navigation manager directive is used\n- use the `NavManager.directive` on the DOM elements that you want to navigate over, or on the parent element that contains the children elements specified by the `selector`\n\n> **For the screen readers like NVDA make sure that the elements that you want to navigate through are _interactive_ (for example, put type=\"button\" on the button element), so that NVDA switches from the _browse_ mode to _focus_ mode. Switch manually to _focus_ mode (by default: Ins + Space) if it doesn't work, as sometimes heuristics doesn't detect the interactive element properly.**\n\n### In action\n\n```sample\n{NavManager:navManager/navManager:255}\n```\n\n### Using selector\n\n```sample\n{NavManager:navManager/navManagerWithSelector:255}\n```\n","Navigation Manager",{"since":14},"0.7.0","# Match Media\n\n## Service Overview\n\n\u003Cp>\nThe match media service is a simple factory that wraps the \u003Ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia\" target=\"_blank\">Window: matchMedia()\u003C/a> method into a Tansu readable store.\n\u003C/p>\n\n```typescript\ntype createMatchMedia = (query: string) => Readable\u003Cboolean>;\n```\n\n## In action\n\n```sample\n{MatchMedia:matchMedia/matchMedia:138}\n```\n","0.3.0"],"uses":{"params":["slug","framework"]}}]}
