Developers commonly devise their own methods to track this information. In AgnosUI, we provide a utility in core services that AgnosUI components leverage for this purpose.\nUtilize the globally readable signal `activeElement$` to monitor the current focused item. If your focus is solely on your DOM element and its descendants, you have the option to generate a custom signal using the `HasFocus` factory.\n\n## Service Overview\n\nThis service exports functionality related to managing focus within a web application. It includes a readable signal, `activeElement$`, representing the currently active HTML element, and a factory function, `createHasFocus()`, that creates an object implementing the `HasFocus` interface.\n\nTo install the core part, open your project's terminal and run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm i @agnos-ui/core\n```\n\n### `activeElement$` Readable Signal\n\n`activeElement$` is a readable signal that provides information about the currently focused HTML element.\nWhen at least a consumer starts listening its value, it sets the active element to the current `document.activeElement`.\nThe active element is updated each time a `focusin`/ `focusout` event is triggered on the `document.documentElement`.\nThe event listeners are removed when the number of listeners fall to 0.\n\n### `createHasFocus` Factory\n\n`createHasFocus` is a factory function that creates an object conforming to the `HasFocus` interface.\nIt provides:\n\n- `directive` that can be apply to elements to track if the focus is on one of the elements or on one of their descendent.\n- `hasFocus$` signal (that internally uses the `activeElement$` signal) that say if the focus is actually among the elements (or their descendent) targeted by the directive.\n\n## Usage\n\nWhenever you want to check which element of the DOM has the focus, you can simply import the signal `activeElement$` and `subscribe` to it.\n\n### In action\n\n```sample\n{Focustrack:focustrack/focustrack:500}\n```\n\n### Example Usage `activeElement$`\n\n```typescript\nimport {activeElement$} from '@agnos-ui/core';}\n\nconst unsubscribe = activeElement$.subscribe((activeElement) => {\n\tconsole.log(`Tag name: ${activeElement?.tagName.toLowerCase()}, id: ${activeElement?.id}`);\n})\n```\n\n### Example Usage `HasFocus`\n\nIf you are only interested to your element and descendent, then you have to use the `createHasFocus` factory, apply the directive to the element, and then subscribe to the `hasFocus$` signal.\n\n```typescript\nimport {createHasFocus} from '@agnos-ui/core';\n\nconst {directive, hasFocus$} = createHasFocus();\n\n// Apply the directive to specific elements\n// (We provide utilities to apply this in the different framework context too)\nvar elementWhereToTrack = document.getElementById('id');\nconst instance = directive(elementWhereToTrack);\n\n// Subscribe to the hasFocus$ signal\nconst unsubscribe = hasFocus$.subscribe((hasFocus) => {\n\tconsole.log(`Focused: ${hasFocus}`);\n});\n\n// Cleanup\nunsubscribe();\ninstance?.destroy();\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- The code ensures proper cleanup by removing event listeners when no longer needed.\n","services/focustrack"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
