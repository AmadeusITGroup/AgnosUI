# Installation

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Create a new project

If you haven't already, create a new project where you want to use AgnosUI. You can use the `blabla` for this.

## Install AgnosUI

AgnosUI provides two flavours of the widgets for you to choose from:

- **Headless**: The {$selectedFramework$}-headless package contains the headless functionality of the widget library. It can be used with any front-end CSS framework. It uses the core of AgnosUI which is framework agnostic.
- **Bootstrap**: The Bootstrap package builds upon the {$selectedFramework$}-headless package to provide additional UI widgets styled with Bootstrap.

To install the headless part, open your project's terminal and run the following command:

```bash
{install-headless}
```

To install the bootstrap part, open your project's terminal and run the following command:

```bash
{install-bootstrap}
```
