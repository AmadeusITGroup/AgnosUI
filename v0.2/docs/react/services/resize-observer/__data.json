It provides a set of options for customization, including positioning configuration, auto-updating behavior, and arrow styling.\n\nThe service uses a 3rd party library called [floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/).\n\nBy leveraging the provided directives and state stores, developers can easily integrate floating UI elements into their web applications with flexibility and control.\n\n## `createFloatingUI` factory\n\nUse the `createFloatingUI` function to create an instance of the Floating UI service.\nPass an optional `propsConfig` parameter to customize the initial configuration.\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nThe `propsConfig` parameter allows you to provide initial values for the following options:\n\n- **computePositionOptions** Option for positioning the floating UI relative to the reference element. Refer to [computePosition documentation](https://floating-ui.com/docs/computeposition#options) for defaults and options.\n- **autoUpdateOptions** Option for enabling auto-updating of the floating position. Refer to [autoUpdate documentation](https://floating-ui.com/docs/autoupdate#options) for defaults and options.\n- **arrowOptions** Option to customize the arrow element associated, by giving the element itself and eventually a padding. Refer to [arrow documentation](https://floating-ui.com/docs/arrow#options) for defaults and options.\n\n## Output Directives\n\n1. **Reference Directive** Apply this directive to the reference element from which the floating UI will be positioned.\n\n2. **Floating Directive** Apply this directive to the floating UI element. This directive includes styling updates based on the floating UI position.\n3. **Arrow Directive** Apply this directive to the arrow element, if present. This directive includes styling updates based on the arrow position.\n\n## State Stores\n\nThe Floating UI service exposes several state stores that represent different aspects of the UI position:\n\n- `x$`: X-coordinate of the floating UI.\n- `y$`: Y-coordinate of the floating UI.\n- `strategy$`: Strategy used for positioning.\n- `placement$`: Placement of the floating UI.\n- `middlewareData$`: Additional data provided by middleware.\n\n## Patching States\n\nFloating UI instance includes a `patch` method that allows you to patch the configuration dynamically at runtime.\n\n## Usage\n\n### In Action\n\n```sample\n{FloatingUI:floatingUI/floatingUI:500}\n```\n","Floating UI","",{"since":8},"0.1.1",{"slug":10,"content":11,"title":12,"subpath":6,"status":6,"attributes":13},"services/transition","# Transition\n\n## Service Overview\n\nThe Transition service allows to display or hide content smoothly through an animation. At its heart, a transition is a [Directive](../01-Headless/03-Directives.md) managing the visibility of inner content by attaching / detaching classes.\n\n## In action\n\nCreating and attaching a transition is straighforward! Simply create a transition service using the factory `createTransition` and attach the provided directive to a dom element.  \nLet's see this in action by implementing a **Collapse** component:\n\n```sample\n{Collapse example:transition/collapse:129}\n```\n\nAgnosUI provides several transition functions to use (collapse vertical or horizontal, fade in/out) but you may create your own using the `createSimpleClassTransition` utility and a bit of css. Here is another example with a flip animation:\n\n```sample\n{Flip in example:transition/flip:93}\n```\n\n\u003Cp>\n    When creating your own, remember to respect the user preferences and the media query \u003Ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion\" target=\"_blank\">prefers-reduced-motion\u003C/a>.\n\u003C/p>\n\n## Properties and stores\n\nYou can configure a transition using the following properties:\n\n- **transition** `TransitionFn` : the transition function that will be run\n- **visible** `boolean` : whether the element should be visible when the transition is completed\n- **animation** `boolean` : whether the transition should be animated\n- **animationOnInit** `boolean` : if the element is initially visible, whether the element should be animated when first displayed\n- **onShown** `() => void` : function to be called when the transition is completed and the element is visible\n- **onHidden** `() => void` : function to be called when the transition is completed and the element is not visible\n- **onVisibleChange** `(visible: boolean) => void` : function to be called when the visible property changes\n\nThe state of the transition will include the stores:\n\n- **visible** `boolean` : whether the element is visible or will be visible when the transition is completed\n- **elementPresent** `boolean` : whether the element to be animated is present in the DOM\n- **element** `HTMLElement | null` : reference to the DOM element\n- **transitioning** `boolean` : whether a transition is currently running\n- **shown** `boolean` : whether the element is visible and not transitioning\n- **hidden** `boolean` : whether the element is not visible and not transitioning\n\nYou may play around the properties and see the stores updated with the following example:\n\n```sample\n{Transition properties and stores:transition/transition:585:noCode:noResize}\n```\n","Transition",{"since":14},"0.2.0","# Resize Observer\n\n## Service Overview\n\nThis service exports functionality related to observing resized elements within a web application. It exposes a factory function, `createResizeObserver()` that creates an object containing one readable signal with the real time **dimensions** of the observed element and a **directive** which will be applied on the HTML element to observe.\n\n### `createResizeObserver` Factory\n\n`createResizeObserver` is a factory function that creates an object providing:\n\n- `dimensions$` Readable Signal providing the real time **dimensions** of the observed element. The type of the object is _ResizeObserverEntry_. See the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserverEntry)\n\n- `directive` - a directive to be applied on the html element to observe. The element to observe can be passed as argument to the directive function in case it cannot be applied directly on the html element.\n\n## Usage\n\nWhenever you want to listen to dimensions changes of an element of the DOM, you can simply:\n\n- use the factory function to create the object containing the **signal** and the **directive**.\n- use the directive to set the element to be observed for resizing\n- use `dimensions$` signal and `subscribe` to it.\n\n### In action\n\n```sample\n{ResizeObserver:resizeObserver/resizeObserver:500}\n```\n\n### Example Usage - using directive as method\n\nUse the directive as method to set the element to listen.\n\n```typescript\nimport {createResizeObserver} from '@agnos-ui/core';\nconst {directive, dimensions$} = createResizeObserver();\nconst resizableElement = document.querySelector('div.main:nth-child(2)');\nconst directiveApplied = directive(resizableElement);\nconst unsubscribe = dimensions$.subscribe((dimensions) => {\n\tconsole.log(`Resizable element width: ${dimensions.contentRect?.width}`);\n});\n// Cleanup\nunsubscribe();\ndirectiveApplied.destroy?.();\n```\n"],"uses":{"params":["slug","framework"]}}]}
