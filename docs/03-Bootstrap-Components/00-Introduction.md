# Introduction to Bootstrap Components

The Bootstrap components are a series of ready-to-use components for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS users. These components come with additional customization layers, configuration features on top of the [Bootstrap ones](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/accordion/). Some components like the Slider (or soon-to-come Tree...) have their own unique styling system that is entirely customizable using CSS variables and are not standard Bootstrap components; we will refer to them as standalone components (which can even be used without Bootstrap CSS). We will provide a method to distinguish the standalone components from the Bootstrap ones.
