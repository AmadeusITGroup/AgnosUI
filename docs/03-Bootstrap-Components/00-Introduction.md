# Introduction to Bootstrap Components

The Bootstrap components are a series of ready-to-use components for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS users. These components come with additional customization layers, configuration features on top of the [Bootstrap ones](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/accordion/). Some components like the Slider (or soon-to-come Tree...) have their own unique styling system that is entirely customizable using CSS variables and are not standard Bootstrap components; we will refer to them as standalone components (which can even be used without Bootstrap CSS). An alert on the documentation page allow to distinguish the standalone components from the Bootstrap ones. We intend to provide (at least) this series of additional components

- Datepicker
- Timepicker
- Tree
- Slider (already available)
