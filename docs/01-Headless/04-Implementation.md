# Introduction to Components creation

We have two types of usage of headless components in this documentation. One type is the Headless components examples (done using DaisyUI), and the other is the Bootstrap components. The Bootstrap components are ready-to-use components available in a specific library. The Headless components examples are just components to copy and paste into your code and adapt to your needs.
