# Introduction to Components creation

We have two types of usage of headless/lifeless components in this documentation. One type is the Headless/Lifeless components examples (done using DaisyUI), and the other is the Bootstrap components. The Bootstrap components are ready-to-use components available in a specific library. The Headless/Lifeless components examples are just components to copy and paste into your code and adapt to your needs.
